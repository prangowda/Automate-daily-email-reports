# Automate-daily-email-reports
To automate sending daily email reports in Python, you'll need to follow these steps:

Set Up Your Environment:

Install the necessary libraries.
Set up your email account to allow sending emails through SMTP.
Write the Python script to generate and send the email report.
Libraries and SMTP Configuration:

smtplib: For sending emails.
email.mime: To create MIME objects for email content.
schedule: To schedule the daily email.
Here's a step-by-step guide to set it up:

Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries
First, make sure you have schedule installed. You can install it using pip:
pip install schedule

Step 2: Write the Python Script
Below is a Python script to send daily email reports. Replace placeholder values with your actual information.

import smtplib
import schedule
import time
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

# Email configuration
smtp_server = 'smtp.your-email-provider.com'
smtp_port = 587
email_user = 'your-email@example.com'
email_password = 'your-email-password'
to_email = 'recipient-email@example.com'

# Function to generate the report content
def generate_report():
    # Replace with your actual report generation logic
    report_content = "Daily report content goes here..."
    return report_content

# Function to send the email
def send_email():
    # Generate the report
    report_content = generate_report()

    # Create the email message
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = email_user
    msg['To'] = to_email
    msg['Subject'] = 'Daily Report'

    # Attach the report content
    msg.attach(MIMEText(report_content, 'plain'))

    try:
        # Connect to the SMTP server
        server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)
        server.starttls()  # Secure the connection
        server.login(email_user, email_password)

        # Send the email
        server.send_message(msg)
        print("Email sent successfully!")

        # Disconnect from the server
        server.quit()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email: {str(e)}")

# Schedule the email to be sent daily at a specific time
schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(send_email)  # Set the desired time here

print("Scheduler started. Waiting to send daily email report...")
while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)  # Wait one minute before checking the schedule again
    
Step 3: Run the Script
To keep the script running and send the email at the scheduled time, you need to run the script continuously. You can do this by running the script in the background or using a task scheduler like cron (for Unix-based systems) or Task Scheduler (for Windows).

Detailed Explanation:
 
 Email Configuration:

smtp_server and smtp_port: These are the SMTP server details of your email provider (e.g., smtp.gmail.com for Gmail).
email_user and email_password: Your email address and password. Note that for security reasons, you might need to generate an app-specific password if you're using Gmail.
Report Generation:

generate_report(): This function should contain the logic for generating the daily report. You can customize it to fetch data from databases, APIs, or any other sources.
Sending Email:

send_email(): This function connects to the SMTP server, logs in, and sends the email with the report.
Scheduling:

schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(send_email): This line schedules the send_email function to run every day at 9:00 AM. Adjust the time as needed.
Running the Scheduler:

The while True loop keeps the script running and checks the schedule every minute.

Security Considerations
Store sensitive information such as email passwords securely. Consider using environment variables or a secrets management service.
Ensure that your email provider allows sending emails through SMTP and has any necessary settings (e.g., less secure app access) enabled.
By following these steps, you can automate sending daily email reports using Python.
